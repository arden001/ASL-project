# ASL Detector

 My project is an ASL alphabet detector. I wanted to make this project because I actually have a deaf cousin, but due to my lack of knowledge of ASL, we have a difficult time communicating. I made this detector to aid in helping people learn/translate the basic foundation of ASL: the alphabet. With my project, I hope that it can turn into somehting bigger and better that will break down the communication barrier between the hearing and hearing impaired. I would love for this project to be able to detect full on ASL conversations and translate them!
 
## The Algorithm

This project depended on the Jetson Nano and python code was used in Visual Studio Code. To get this project to work, I had to find/create a dataset then download it into the jetson-inference directory. I then re-trained my network to process and detect the dataset. I used imagenet to detect what the hand sign was and output the percentage of what the letter was.
