# ASL-project
iD Tech Academy Final Project:
I created this project to aid in closing the language barrier between the hearing and the hearing impaired. Since ASL is not the most common language, I figured this could be an easier way of trying to communicate with someone who is either hearing or hearing impaired. My project is able to detect every letter in the ASL alphabet and output what that letter is.
